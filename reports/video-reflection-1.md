## reflections on rhetoric

Select two authors whose ideas on discovering stories we have read,
viewed, or discussed.

  - Jonathan Corum (whale dive and feed)  
  - Amanda Cox (one image, two interpretations)  
  - David McCandless (the billion-dollar-o-gram)  
  - Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic (blog posts)  
  - Eric Rodenbeck (maps of emotion)

**Prompt:** For each of the two authors you select, reflect on their
ideas and their messages. What is the most significant idea you can
borrow from them that you can apply to your own portfolio? Make your
responses as specific as you can.

**Response:** Amanda Cox’s graph of the effects of the tax bill

I was really struck by the graph showing how the projected effects of
the tax bill on taxes paid by the super wealthy–.-they are receiving a
huge windfall—compared to the middle class, many of whom who end up
paying more taxes than they do presently. The Trump administration’s tax
policy clearly favors people with the very highest incomes, though their
rhetoric is populist.

The powerful idea I took away was that we could plot over 200,000
individual data markers yet still show a compelling story without
statistical summaries. And interactivity is not necessary.

Because our portfolios are hosted online, the dimensions of the graph do
not have to be limited like they would be if we were using print pages.
I can adjust the size of my graph to be as large as needed to allow the
data and message to come across.

I’m not sure yet which of my displays will benefit from this idea—what
I’ll watch out for is a display that could be shown twice with
different aspect ratios. A wide and short display to show one view of
the data and next a much taller aspect ratio to be able to see local
variations more clearly. This is what Amanda was showing us again and
again as she interactively changed the aspect ratio of her graph.

**Response:** Second response
